=Checklist=

==Footprints==
===LT8612===
Checked. All okay. 

===Battery Holder===
Pads were too far apart. Corrected.

===Programming Header===
Pads were incorrect size. Changed to what Samtec suggest

===Inductor===
All okay.

===Oscillator===
All okay.

===LED===
Does not match recommended land pattern due to space constraints. Need to ensure all tracks connect well and can carry current.

===AVR===
Standard footprint. Correct pitch and size.

===Switches===
All okay.


==Layout==
===Vin===
Vin track is appropriately sized for expected currents.

===SMPS===
Matches the recommended layout reasonably well.

===Vpp Connections===
11 connections
Total LED current:
R=0.05A=3A
B=0.025A=1.5A
G=0.025A=1.5A
=6A/11 = 0.55A
For 10C rise - 0.13mm track. We have 0.5mm so plenty. Maybe too big but not demanding on space. 

===LED Driving circuit===
The OE can be PWM driven to globally dim - unfortunately don't have enough PWM on the uC so not worth it. 
I2C addresses are okay - the is a sub call function in the devices that by default will clash with the assigned, however, this feature is off by default.

Current out of GND pin (max):
5xRed=0.250
5xBlue=0.125
5xGreen=0.125
Total: 0.5A
0.3mm via is good to an Amp.
Got four on each GND pin. Safe.

===Grounding paths===
This is a big problem. I cannot see the return path for some of the LED drivers. Need to sort this. 


===Microcontroller Circuit===
Quite simple here. Got some connectors, passives and switches. 
Decoupling - okay.
all load caps are correct. 
Routing is acceptable. some caps could be closer, but not too fussed.
